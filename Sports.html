               <p>India is a cricket obsessed nation. Although Dhyanchand, a hockey magician, with three Olympic gold medals, has his birthday (August 29th) marked as National Sports Day of India. This year, the celebration is particularly significant, considering that India's recent sporting achievements have got the attention of the entire world. The javelin sensation Neeraj Chopra won gold in the World Athletics Championships. Chess prodigy R. Praggnanandhaa scripted history by winning the silver at the World Cup. And, HS Prannoy's victory over the world number one at the Badminton World Championships earned him a bronze. These three victories symbolize the new rising India in sports.<br><br>
                  But, then, these achievements make one reflect. Why do such victories not come by more often? India is witnessing a slow, yet assuredly positive change in its sporting scenario, validated by both the Olympic glory in Tokyo 2020 and the recent ICC Women's Cricket World Cup. Talent is cropping up in new sports such as weightlifting, boxing, and wrestling, to add to its ever-growing size of young chess players. The government schemes like Khelo India and Fit India are bringing in much-needed impetus. Yet, it is still moving at a snail's pace.<br><br>
                  To start with, take the disparity of support and amount of money that cricket receives as compared to other sports. Hockey players were paid 50,000 rupees each per month to prepare for the Tokyo Olympics. Compare this to the five crore rupees each that the Indian cricket team got for winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in January 2021. The BCCI had a turnover of over 4,000 crores in 2018 alone, while the meager 1,943 crores were the combined amount allocated for all other sports in the same year.<br><br>
                  India won its best-ever Olympic performance in Tokyo, finishing with seven medals. However, with a population of 1.4 billion, India has produced only a handful of star athletes. History of the spending amount betrays a disjointed policy on sports funding. The 2010 Commonwealth Games had an initial budget of around 2,250 crore rupees, which escalated to around 33,750 crore rupees in the end, thus turning it into the most expensive CWG ever. And yet, India finished on the second spot of the medal table, winning 101 medals.<br><br>
                  The Olympic journey thereafter has been somewhat different. In 2012, India won six medals but spent only 1,152 crore rupees on sports. The budget had incremental increases, but the not so noticeable peaks were visible in Olympic years; in 2020, despite the COVID-19 scenario, an increase to 2,826 crore rupees was managed, followed by a 10% cut in the very next year.<br><br>
                  Hockey, one of India's fortes, had to struggle with sponsorships. In 2018, even the Odisha government had to bail it out with 150 crore rupees after Sahara exited, thus proving that support for sports, barring cricket, is quite fickle. The BCCI has a net worth of 14,489 crore rupees back in 2018, while IPL's revenue alone was more than the nation's sports budget for that year.<br><br>
                  The spirit of India's athletes, however, is what legends are made of. Stories of Mirabai Chanu, Lovlina Borgohain, PV Sindhu, Ravi Dahiya, Bajrang Punia, and Neeraj Chopra are stories of an extraordinary struggle and triumph against insurmountable odds. Their wins in Tokyo will make a significant difference to the saga of Indian sport. As India celebrates 74 years of independence, the country's potential in sports is much yet untapped. The emphasis should be on nurturing talent and providing consistent support for all sports. If India can provide the right infrastructure and funding, then it can dream of entering the top bracket of world sports and should set its goal of a top-10 finish at the 2024 Olympics. The journey is hard, but the spirit and potential of India's athletes tell us that the country can be the greatest.
